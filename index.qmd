# ABOUT

This data was downloaded from the website of the Gapminder Foundation.

Description: The happiness score is the national average response to the question of life evaluations asking the following "Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from O at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life
for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?" This measure is also referred to as Cantril life ladder.

Gapminder has converted this indicator's scale from 0 to 100 to easly communicate it in terms of percentage.
